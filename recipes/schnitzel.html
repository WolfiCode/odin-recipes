        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This traditional German Schnitzel recipe, known as Schweineschnitzel, is just the way you know and love it from your favorite German restaurants!  Made the way I learned it from my Mutti and Oma, this tutorial includes all the tips and tricks are included for making the absolute PERFECT Schnitzel!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pork:</strong> 4-6 pork chops</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> 1 cup of basic flour</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> 4 large eggs</li>
            <li><strong>Whipping cream:</strong> 1/3 of a cup</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon zest:</strong> 1/2 a lemon</li>
            <li><strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> 2 cups of Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> For frying</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper:</strong> Coarse salt and fresh crached pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place flour on a plate. Coat chicken in flour. Shake off excess - this helps prevent a gluggy coating on the finished schnitzel.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Whisk egg and milk together in a shallow bowl. Dip flour-coated chicken in egg mixture. Let excess egg mixture drip back into bowl.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Combine breadcrumbs, cheese, lemon rind, parsley and garlic powder on a plate. Season with salt and pepper. Dip egg-coated chicken in breadcrumb mixture. Gently press on with fingertips to secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Cook schnitzels, in batches, for 4 to 5 minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. Cooking in batches helps maintain oil temperature and prevents schnitzels becoming soggy.</li>
            </ol>
